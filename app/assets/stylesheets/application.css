/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css.
 *
 * With Propshaft, assets are served efficiently without preprocessing steps. 
 * You can still include application-wide styles in this file, but keep in mind 
 * that CSS precedence follows the standard cascading order. 
 * Styles declared later in the document or manifest will override earlier ones, 
 * depending on specificity.
 *
 * Consider organizing styles into separate files for maintainability.
